description: Far in the future, the planet Hawaika is a tropical paradise settled
  by a small group of descendants of modern-day Hawaiians and Polynesians. But Ross
  Murdock and Gordon Ashe are not there to languish on the planet's beautiful beaches
  -- they want to establish a portal to the past. Will they succeed in their quest
  to find out what became of the ancient civilizations that once thrived on Hawaika?
